My projects on Github are more like a tutorial than a finished product: [bestia-dev tutorials](https://github.com/bestia-dev/tutorials_rust_wasm).  

## Containerized Rust development environment - CRDE

We will repeat how to create a Containerized Rust development environment (CRDE). Things change over time and the old tutorials might be outdated.
It is also good to start from scratch from time to time to avoid accumulating side-effects that we forget about. It is very easy to reset everything because we use containers.



## Cross-compile

We will cross compile to Linux, Windows, musl, WASI and WASM from our CRDE.





## Open-source and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful, please buy me a beer by donating to my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
